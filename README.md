RESTAURANT PAGE: ANNABELLE'S SWEET SAFARI

A simple restaurant website with a focus on bright and friendly designs to appeal to families.

--DEVELOPMENT--

This project was developed for the webpack module of the Odin Project curriculum. It uses basic modules to toggle content between tabs. I added quite a bit of styling,
and decided to stick to purely DOM manipulation for all elements, which got a little messy, but was very educational.

Once the Javascript was in working order, I used:

    *Adobe Illustrator - to create the custom header logos, savannah silhouette footers, and cloud icon for the active tab.
    *color.adobe.com - to create a custom color palette.
    *Google Fonts - Fresca Reg for titles, Mada for regular text.

I optimized for the iPhone in portrait and landscape orientations.
